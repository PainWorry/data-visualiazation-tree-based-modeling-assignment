# Tree-Based Predictive Modeling Assignment

This project implements tree-based predictive models using the California Housing dataset.

## Files
- `assignment_solution.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis.
- `step_by_step_guide.md`: Detailed instructions for running the project.

## Requirements
To run the code, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost notebook
```

## How to Run
1.  Open the terminal/command prompt.
2.  Navigate to this folder.
3.  Run `launch_notebook.bat` (or double-click it in the folder) and open `assignment_solution.ipynb`.
4.  Execute all cells to generate the analysis and plots.

## Models Implemented
1.  Decision Tree
2.  Random Forest
3.  Gradient Boosting (using XGBoost)
4.  AdaBoost

## Evaluation Metrics
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
- **R²** (Coefficient of Determination)
